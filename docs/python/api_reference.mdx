## Initialization
To initialize the nebuly module, you need to perform the following step at the beginning of your code:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    nebuly.init(
        project="my_project",
        phase=nebuly.DevelopmentPhase.EXPERIMENTATION,
    )
```

<Note>Before initializing nebuly you must provide an API Key by assigning it to `nebuly.api_key` </Note>

Once nebuly is initialized your AI workloads are **automatically** tracked.

### nebuly.init - Arguments Details
The `nebuly.init` method is used to initialize the nebuly module. It takes the following parameters:
<ParamField body="project" type="str" required>
  The name of your project. This serves as a tag to organize your data across different projects.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="phase" type="DevelopmentPhase(Enum)" required>
  The current development phase of your project. It serves as a tag to organize your data based on the project's development stage.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="task" type="Task(Enum)" default="Task.UNKNOWN" optional>
   The task that your current code is performing. If you don't specify a task, it will be automatically detected for each tracked record. If you do specify a task, all the records captured in your code will be recorded with the specified task.
</ParamField>


## Track Specific Code Sections or Methods
To selectively track specific code sections or methods, you can utilize the `nebuly` context manager. This feature enables you to associate multiple `project` or `phase` values within the same code, as well as manually assign a specific `task` to your code.

<Warning> Ensure that nebuly.tracker() is used after initializing nebuly. </Warning>


```python

def my_method():
    # some code

    with nebuly.tracker(task=nebuly.Task.TEXT_SUMMARIZATION):
        # the code to be tracked with specified arguments
    
    # some other code
```


```python

@nebuly.tracker(project="second_project", phase=nebuly.DevelopmentPhase.PRODUCTION)
def my_method():
    # your code
```

### nebuly.tracker - Arguments Details
The `nebuly.tracker` method is used to manually change the tags for specific code sections. It takes the following parameters:
<ParamField body="project" type="str" optional>
  The name of your project. This serves as a tag to organize your data across different projects.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="phase" type="DevelopmentPhase(Enum)" optional>
  The current development phase of your project. It serves as a tag to organize your data based on the project's development stage.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="task" type="Task(Enum)" optional>
  The task that your current code is accomplishing. If specified overwrite the one that is automatically detected.
</ParamField>
